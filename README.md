Inspired by mario RPG games, I wanted to make a turn based combat system similar to it.
Similar in the fact that you play minigames to do special attacks.
It is stylized in the 2D sprite on 3D background style like paper mario.

So far, I have implemented a character sprite system, Turn tracking, attacking, Stats and random stat generation, Killing and attacking, and a simple 3d spinning animated background made to look like a road.

I used my other project where I made turn tracking in this project.

I left off last working on a system for attack minigames. The only one I have worked on and yet to implement was the rythm game. I want to make a tool before going further.

I plan to have dynamic stage loading, character equipment, and a functional GUI before I call this proof of concept complete.
